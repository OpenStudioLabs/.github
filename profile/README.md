# Open Studio Labs

We understand Open Source Software and the issues companies face when they utilize OSS.

Too often, companies have become accustomed to tackling the tasks of getting new features, fixing bug issues, and enhancing cybersecurity via workarounds or pestering the Maintainer.

Our solution delivers engineering support to under-resourced OSS projects, ultimately helping companies reduce their technical debt.

*[Open Studio Labs](https://www.OpenStudioLabs.com/)* is developing a **Development-as-a-Service (DaaS)** platform to help product managers enhance and secure open-source software they depend upon using an *Engineering Residency* program.

We make upstream **Enterprise Open Source Software** for a *Better World*.

Our *Engineering Residency* cultivates **next-gen** engineers who contribute to the open-source software depended upon by most technology companies.
