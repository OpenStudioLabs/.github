# Open Studio Labs

We understand *Open Source* Software.

**[Open Studio Labs](https://OpenStudioLabs.com/)** is a *"First-of-its-kind"* **residency** conceived to crack the open-source talent shortage for **CTOs** and **engineering teams**. Itâ€™s specialized U.S.-based engineers in upstream open-source projects to aid them in managing every *growing* **technical debt**, *aggressive* **security vulnerabilities**, and the *challenge* of **under-supported** projects.


Similar to a Medical School residency model, Open Studio Labs accelerates development, assures security, and produces a sustainable engineering talent pipeline, providing **clear ROI** for enterprises reliant on open-source to focus on their customers' needs. Unlike traditional volunteer or in-house teams, Open Studio Labs'Labs' focus practices of "See it," "Learn it," and "Teach It" offer focused, **reliable-trained** engineers with hands-on experience and a public portfolio, **de-risking** and **improving** open-source project _**sustainability**_.
